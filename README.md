What is **Polyhedral**? Polyhedral is the working title for a free and open game
system that is compatible with modern versions of [Dungeons & Dragons][_wotc_dnd],
as well as a game system that stands on its own. Polyhedral will be licensed and
distributed under CC-BY for maximum flexibility for publishers, storytellers,
and others seeking to use the system.

The core of Polyhedral is not-for-profit and will always be freely accessible to
everyone.

**Polyhedral is a community effort and we are looking for contributors.**

### Why not just use the D&D rules with the OGL?
The Open Gaming License, or OGL, has been a useful tool to bring new authors,
game designers, and developers into the marketplace since its introduction in
2000, the effort was spearheaded by Ryan Dancey who stated in an interview that
he thought "there's a very, very strong business case that can be made for the
idea of embracing the ideas at the heart of the Open Source movement and finding
a place for them in gaming."

The OGL, in many ways, accomplished its goals. However, changes to the OGL for
future versions of D&D mean that the license is becoming less-open and as a
result we want to take the opportunity to create a truly free, and open game
system that is built by a passionate community which can also serve as the basis
for their own projects.

### Polyhedral Design Philosophy

Polyhedral has the following design philosophy that is guiding its development:

1. Create a rules-compatible interface for the first edition of Polyhedral that
   allows it to be (as much as possible) a drop-in replacement with D&D 5th
   Edition and 5th edition-compatible games.
2. Remain free and open by using a permissive, industry-standard, license: the
   Creative Commons CC-BY license. We want everyone to be able to use
   Polyhedral, remix it, build on top of itm and redistribute it without any
   barriers. a true, open, game system.
3. Modularity by design is at the heart of Polyhedral. We're aiming to create a
   rules-light system which includes the rules you need to play and nothing you
   don't. Publishers can augment these rules by adding on to them.

### Rules Distribution
How do you get the rules for Polyhedral? There are a number of places where you might
find the Polyhedral rules:

- You will find raw text and other electronic distributions of the core rules
  here.
- The rules may be reproduced in other materials (electronic, print, etc.).
- In the future we may offer a print-version of the core rules, in association
  with close partners (this doesn't mean there won't be other print versions).

### How do I know if I'm using the "right" version of Polyhedral?
Polyhedral's goal is to be open source, that means that if a game is built on
Polyhedral's rules there is no "right" or "wrong" version of the game, no
authorized or unauthorized versions. Some games may use more or less of the core
rules, depending on whether those rules work for them or not.

With that being said, because Polyhedral is being designed with modularity in
mind we expect most changes to the rules by publishers and storytellers to be
additive.

Polyhedral releases will be managed as **editions** (instead of versions) and
game designers are encouraged to denote compatibility with a particular edition.
Rules should mostly be compatible across all products using the same edition of
Polyhedral.

### Keeping Polyhedral Growing and Healthy
In order to keep things compatible and to keep the game system healthy we
encourage game designers to use as much of the core rules as possible without
making fundamental changes and contribute any game mechanics that they can (i.e.
not Intellectual Property) back to the core of the system.
