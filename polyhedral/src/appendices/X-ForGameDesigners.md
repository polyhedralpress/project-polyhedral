# Appendix: For Game Designers

Games built on {{book.product}} should use the same language when presenting
game mechanics, rules, etc. This allows for a coherent, and cohesive,
presentation of the {{book.product}}-based games. By using the same language it
becomes easier for players and storytellers alike to understand the rules and
makes it easier to address confusion in the rules.

Below are examples of how the rules are written in {{book.product}}'s core and
it is recommended that you follow a similar style. With that being said, you may
find it necessary to present a rule or a mechanic using different language. In
this event prefer simplicity and ease of understanding over complexity.

## Ability Checks using Skills
When presenting an ability check that uses a skill, such as the Athletics skill
and Strength, use the format: **Ability Name (Skill Name)**, e.g. **Strength
(Athletics)**.

## When to use "Ranks"
A character's advancement, overall, is their "level". However advancement in a
particular area: job, abilities, skills, etc. should be denoted as "ranks".
Examples of the usage of ranks in the game:

- Ability ranks
- Skill ranks
- Job ranks
