The fighter is, perhaps, the purest of martial combatants and epitomizes the
role of the warrior. Soldiers, mercenaries, many adventurers, and wanders all
live their life from one battlefield to another. Some warriors spend their lives
perfecting their martial techniques or honing their skill with a particular
weapon.

### Fighting Style
You have trained in a particular fighting-style. Choose one of the options
below. Whenever you gain a rank in this job, you can replace a fighting style
you know with another fighting style available to this job. You can't take the
same fighting style more than once.

___Blind Fighting.___ You have blindsight with a range of 10 ft. Even if you are
  blinded or in an area that is heavily obscured, you can effectively "see"
  anything that isn't behind total cover, including a creature that is invisible
  unless it successfully hides from you.

___Defense.___ While wearing armor, you gain a +2 bonus to your Defense rating.

___Dueling.___ When wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
  when you miss with an attack you can reroll the attack. You must use the new
  roll. You can use this ability once per turn.

___Great Weapon Fighting.___ You double your Strength bonus to the damage dealt
  when you hit with a weapon that you are wielding with two hands. The weapon
  must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

___Marksmanship.___ You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged
  weapons.

___Protection.___ When a creature that you can see hits a target other than you
  with and that target is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to
  interpose yourself between the creature and the attack taking the damage
  instead of the intended target. Until the start of your next turn attacks
  against that creature have disadvantage.

___Thrown Weapons.___ You can draw weapons with the thrown property as part of
  an attack you make with them. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack
  using a thrown weapon, you double the weapon's damage dice.

___Two-Weapon Fighting.___ When wielding two weapons, one in each hand, you can
  add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

___Unarmed Fighting.___ Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to
  1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a
  shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of
  each of your turns, you deal 5 bludgeoning damage to one creature you are
  grappling with.

### Second Wind
As a bonus action on your turn, you regain health equal to 2D + twice your
fighter rank. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest
before you can use it again.

### Action Surge
Starting at rank 2, you can take one additional action on your turn. Once you
use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again.

### Martial Path
When you reach rank 3, you choose a path from the available fighter paths. The
path you choose grants you features at the following ranks: 6th, 8th, 10th and
13th.

### Provoke
At rank 4, as a bonus action on your turn, choose one creature that you can see
and that can hear you. Until the end of your next turn that creature has
disadvantage on attacks against targets other than you.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at rank 5, you can attack twice instead of once, when you take the
Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you
reach rank 11 and to four when you reach rank 14.

### Indomitable
Starting at rank 7, when you fail a saving throw you can choose to succeed
instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at rank rank 11.

### Strike True
Beginning when you reach rank 14, you can use a bonus action on your turn to
grant yourself perfect insight on the next attack you make. Before the start of
your next turn, the next attack you make automatically hits its target, as if
you rolled the minimum needed to hit the target.

### Limit Break
Upon reaching rank 15, you can choose one limit break ability, provided that you
meet the requirements for it. In addition, you can continue advancing in this
job's rank. You gain an additional limit break every 5 ranks, for example you
gain an additional limit break at rank 20, another at rank 25, rank 30, etc.
