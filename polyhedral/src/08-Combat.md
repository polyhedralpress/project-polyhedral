# Chapter 8. Combat and Conflict
The ring of steel-on-steel, the concussive blast from a cannon sounding above
the din of battle, the clash of magical energies exploding. Combat can be brutal
and bloody.

In the previous chapter, the structure of a {{book.product}} game is discussed,
combat almost always takes place in the context of an action scene. As with all
actions, combat is resolved through a series of dice rolls, namely ability
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.

This chapter details the rules for combat in the {{book.product}} game system, including:

- The **sequence of combat**, following the defined initiative order.
- More detailed explanation of **making attacks**, and **using special actions**
- Character **injury, death, and dying** as well as **healing**.

## The Order of Combat
Combat encounters are chaotic melees between two or more groups. The clash of
steel and the dance of adversaries as they feint, parry, and dodge fatal blows
amid a rain of arrows and magic. The {{book.product}} game organizes combat with
an action scene into a cycle of rounds and turns.

Every round represents one-tenth of a minute, or 6 seconds in the course of the
action scene.

A combat encounter follows these steps:

1. **Determine surprise.** The storyteller determines whether any combatants are
   surprised, if they are the combat begins with a surprise round.
2. **Starting positions.** The storyteller sets the stage of the battle and
   works with the players to detemine their characters' positions. In addition,
   the storyteller figures out where the adversaries are in relation to the
   characters.
3. **Roll initiative.** Every actor involved in the combat rolls initiative to
   determine when they act in the combat.
4. **Take turns.** On each participant's turn during the battle, they move and
   take actions including making attacks, defending, etc.
5. **Begin the next round.** After all participants have taken their turns, the
   current round ends and a new round begins. Repeat step 4 and 5 until the
   combat ends.

### Surpise!
Bandits lying in wait on the side of a wooded highway to ambush merchants, and
adventurers descending quietly behind enemy lines to spring an attack. These are
just two examples of situations where one group might take another by surprise.

At the start of combat, the storyteller determines whether any combatants are
surprised. If neither side is attempting to hide or be stealthy, both sides are
aware of each other and there is no surprise round. Otherwise, the Agility
(Stealth) check of the actors or the group that is hiding compared to the
passive Mind (Awareness) score of other creatures. If a creature doesn't notice
the threat it is surprised. A member of a group can be surprised, even if its
allies are not.

If you are surprised, you can't move or take any action (including bonus actions
and reactions) on or before your first turn in the combat.

### Initiative
As discussed in the section on [Game
Structure](./07-PlayingTheGame.html#initiative-order), initiative is what
determines the order of action in the scene, and that includes combat.

Every participant makes an Agility check to determine where in the order of
initiative their turn will fall. The players roll for each of their characters
and any creature they control while the storyteller makes the Agility check for
the non-player characters and creatures. Usually the storyteller will roll for
groups of identical creatures, such that each member of the group acts at the
same time, but it is up to the storyteller to decide how they will roll
initiative.

In the event that two or more creatures are tied for the same initiative, you
can choose how to resolve it, here are a few approaches you might take, you can
also mix approaches:

- Creatures with the highest Agility act first.
- Participants that are tied each roll another Agility check, with the highest
  roll going first among the tied creatures.
- Player-controlled characters have priority over storyteller-controlled
  creatures
- Players decide the order among one another if multiple player-controlled
  characters have same initiatives. Similarly, if multiple
  storyteller-controlled creatures have the same initiative, the storyteller
  decides the order for those creatures.

### Taking Your Turn
On your turn you can do the following: **move** a distance up to your speed,
**take one action** such as making an attack, defending, casting a spell, etc.,
and use one of your **bonus actions**.

#### Movement
On your turn you are able to move a distance equal to your speed.

You decide whether to move before, during, or after your action. Your movement
and the position of enemies might obstruct your ability to take certain actions.
See the section on Movement and Positioning below for more details.

#### Actions
You can take any action presented under [Actions](./07-PlayingTheGame.html#actions)
in Chapter 7, in addition to any actions you have available due to your features
and talents.

The most common action that characters take in combat, however, is the attack
action.

#### Bonus Actions
You may have an ability, from a job, spell, or another source that allows you to
take a special action on your turn called a bonus action. You can take only one
bonus action on your turn, in the event that you have access to more than one
bonus action you must choose which you will use.

Unless a bonus action has specific requirements indicating when it can be taken,
you choose when to take the bonus action. Anything that prevents you from taking
actions also prevents you from using your bonus action.

#### Reactions
Under certain circumstances, or because of an ability that you have, you might
have the opportunity to take a special action called a reaction. Unlike actions
and bonus actions, reactions do not necessarily take place on your turn. A
reaction is a response to a triggering event of some kind. The trigger might
happen on your turn or on another actor's turn.

Opportunity attacks, described later in this chapter, are a common reaction that
all creatures can take.

When you use your reaction, you can't take another reaction until the start of
your next turn. If a reaction triggers on another creature's turn, you can take
your reaction and the creature who triggered the reaction continues their turn
after the reaction is resolved.

#### Other Activities in Combat
In addition to the above, you can do the following on your turn:

- If you are capable of communicating, you are able to do so. You do this
  alongside the actions you are taking. Examples of this are speaking in short
  phrases, issuing single-word commands, and making gestures to your allies (or
  enemies!) alike.
- You can provide more detail to the actions that you are taking, embellishing
  them in such a way that effects neither the action you are taking or your
  movement.
- You can interact freely with one objetc or feature of the environment, as per
  the rules on [Free Interactions](./07-PlayingTheGame.html#free-interactions)
  in Chapter 7.

The storyteller may allow you to perform other activities as part of your turn,
those along with the above may or may not require an action depending on the
complexity or level of focus required for the action you are attempting.
