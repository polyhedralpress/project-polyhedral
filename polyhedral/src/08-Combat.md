# Combat
# Chapter 8. Combat and Conflict
The ring of steel-on-steel, the concussive blast from a cannon sounding above
the din of battle, the clash of magical energies exploding. Combat can be brutal
and bloody.

In the previous chapter, the structure of a {{book.product}} game is discussed,
combat almost always takes place in the context of an action scene. As with all
actions, combat is resolved through a series of dice rolls, namely ability
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.

This chapter details the rules for combat in the {{book.product}} game system, including:

- The **sequence of combat**, following the defined initiative order.
- More detailed explanation of **making attacks**, and **using special actions**
- Character **injury, death, and dying** as well as **healing**.

## The Order of Combat
Combat encounters are chaotic melees between two or more groups. The clash of
steel and the dance of adversaries as they feint, parry, and dodge fatal blows
amid a rain of arrows and magic. The {{book.product}} game organizes combat with
an action scene into a cycle of rounds and turns.

Every round represents one-tenth of a minute, or 6 seconds in the course of the
action scene.

A combat encounter follows these steps:

1. **Determine surprise.** The storyteller determines whether any combatants are
   surprised, if they are the combat begins with a surprise round.
2. **Starting positions.** The storyteller sets the stage of the battle and
   works with the players to detemine their characters' positions. In addition,
   the storyteller figures out where the adversaries are in relation to the
   characters.
3. **Roll initiative.** Every actor involved in the combat rolls initiative to
   determine when they act in the combat.
4. **Take turns.** On each participant's turn during the battle, they move and
   take actions including making attacks, defending, etc.
5. **Begin the next round.** After all participants have taken their turns, the
   current round ends and a new round begins. Repeat step 4 and 5 until the
   combat ends.

### Surpise!
Bandits lying in wait on the side of a wooded highway to ambush merchants, and
adventurers descending quietly behind enemy lines to spring an attack. These are
just two examples of situations where one group might take another by surprise.

At the start of combat, the storyteller determines whether any combatants are
surprised. If neither side is attempting to hide or be stealthy, both sides are
aware of each other and there is no surprise round. Otherwise, the Agility
(Stealth) check of the actors or the group that is hiding compared to the
passive Mind (Awareness) score of other creatures. If a creature doesn't notice
the threat it is surprised. A member of a group can be surprised, even if its
allies are not.

If you are surprised, you can't move or take any action (including bonus actions
and reactions) on or before your first turn in the combat.
