# Chapter 8. Combat and Conflict
The ring of steel-on-steel, the concussive blast from a cannon sounding above
the din of battle, the clash of magical energies exploding. Combat can be brutal
and bloody.

In the previous chapter, the structure of a {{book.product}} game is discussed,
combat almost always takes place in the context of an action scene. As with all
actions, combat is resolved through a series of dice rolls, namely ability
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.

This chapter details the rules for combat in the {{book.product}} game system, including:

- The **sequence of combat**, following the defined initiative order.
- More detailed explanation of **making attacks**, and **using special actions**
- Character **injury, death, and dying** as well as **healing**.

## The Order of Combat
Combat encounters are chaotic melees between two or more groups. The clash of
steel and the dance of adversaries as they feint, parry, and dodge fatal blows
amid a rain of arrows and magic. The {{book.product}} game organizes combat with
an action scene into a cycle of rounds and turns.

Every round represents one-tenth of a minute, or 6 seconds in the course of the
action scene.

A combat encounter follows these steps:

1. **Determine surprise.** The storyteller determines whether any combatants are
   surprised, if they are the combat begins with a surprise round.
2. **Starting positions.** The storyteller sets the stage of the battle and
   works with the players to detemine their characters' positions. In addition,
   the storyteller figures out where the adversaries are in relation to the
   characters.
3. **Roll initiative.** Every actor involved in the combat rolls initiative to
   determine when they act in the combat.
4. **Take turns.** On each participant's turn during the battle, they move and
   take actions including making attacks, defending, etc.
5. **Begin the next round.** After all participants have taken their turns, the
   current round ends and a new round begins. Repeat step 4 and 5 until the
   combat ends.

### Surpise!
Bandits lying in wait on the side of a wooded highway to ambush merchants, and
adventurers descending quietly behind enemy lines to spring an attack. These are
just two examples of situations where one group might take another by surprise.

At the start of combat, the storyteller determines whether any combatants are
surprised. If neither side is attempting to hide or be stealthy, both sides are
aware of each other and there is no surprise round. Otherwise, the Agility
(Stealth) check of the actors or the group that is hiding compared to the
passive Mind (Awareness) score of other creatures. If a creature doesn't notice
the threat it is surprised. A member of a group can be surprised, even if its
allies are not.

If you are surprised, you can't move or take any action (including bonus actions
and reactions) on or before your first turn in the combat.

### Initiative
As discussed in the section on [Game
Structure](./07-PlayingTheGame.html#initiative-order), initiative is what
determines the order of action in the scene, and that includes combat.

Every participant makes an Agility check to determine where in the order of
initiative their turn will fall. The players roll for each of their characters
and any creature they control while the storyteller makes the Agility check for
the non-player characters and creatures. Usually the storyteller will roll for
groups of identical creatures, such that each member of the group acts at the
same time, but it is up to the storyteller to decide how they will roll
initiative.

In the event that two or more creatures are tied for the same initiative, you
can choose how to resolve it, here are a few approaches you might take, you can
also mix approaches:

- Creatures with the highest Agility act first.
- Participants that are tied each roll another Agility check, with the highest
  roll going first among the tied creatures.
- Player-controlled characters have priority over storyteller-controlled
  creatures
- Players decide the order among one another if multiple player-controlled
  characters have same initiatives. Similarly, if multiple
  storyteller-controlled creatures have the same initiative, the storyteller
  decides the order for those creatures.

### Taking Your Turn
On your turn you can do the following: **move** a distance up to your speed,
**take one action** such as making an attack, defending, casting a spell, etc.,
and use one of your **bonus actions**.

#### Movement
On your turn you are able to move a distance equal to your speed.

You decide whether to move before, during, or after your action. Your movement
and the position of enemies might obstruct your ability to take certain actions.
See the section on Movement and Positioning below for more details.

#### Actions
You can take any action presented under [Actions](./07-PlayingTheGame.html#actions)
in Chapter 7, in addition to any actions you have available due to your features
and talents.

The most common action that characters take in combat, however, is the attack
action.

#### Bonus Actions
You may have an ability, from a job, spell, or another source that allows you to
take a special action on your turn called a bonus action. You can take only one
bonus action on your turn, in the event that you have access to more than one
bonus action you must choose which you will use.

Unless a bonus action has specific requirements indicating when it can be taken,
you choose when to take the bonus action. Anything that prevents you from taking
actions also prevents you from using your bonus action.

#### Reactions
Under certain circumstances, or because of an ability that you have, you might
have the opportunity to take a special action called a reaction. Unlike actions
and bonus actions, reactions do not necessarily take place on your turn. A
reaction is a response to a triggering event of some kind. The trigger might
happen on your turn or on another actor's turn.

Opportunity attacks, described later in this chapter, are a common reaction that
all creatures can take.

When you use your reaction, you can't take another reaction until the start of
your next turn. If a reaction triggers on another creature's turn, you can take
your reaction and the creature who triggered the reaction continues their turn
after the reaction is resolved.

#### Other Activities in Combat
In addition to the above, you can do the following on your turn:

- If you are capable of communicating, you are able to do so. You do this
  alongside the actions you are taking. Examples of this are speaking in short
  phrases, issuing single-word commands, and making gestures to your allies (or
  enemies!) alike.
- You can provide more detail to the actions that you are taking, embellishing
  them in such a way that effects neither the action you are taking or your
  movement.
- You can interact freely with one objetc or feature of the environment, as per
  the rules on [Free Interactions](./07-PlayingTheGame.html#free-interactions)
  in Chapter 7.

The storyteller may allow you to perform other activities as part of your turn,
those along with the above may or may not require an action depending on the
complexity or level of focus required for the action you are attempting.

## Making an Attack
Attacking is one of the most common actions in combat. You can make attacks with
melee weapons, ranged weapons, and spells. If you are ever unsure whether an
action you are taking is considered an attack, the rules are simple: if the
action calls for an attack roll the action is an attack.

When you attack another creature, whether it is with a weapon or some spells,
you make an attack roll. All attacks follow the same structure:

1. **Decide on the attack and choose a target.** Choose what attack you are
   going to make and select a target within range. The target could be a
   creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine situational modifiers.** The storyteller will inform you whether
   or not you have an situational modifiers to your dice pool or your roll,
   including whether or not the target has cover, if you have advantage or
   disadvantage, etc.
3. **Resolve the attack.** When you hit with an attack you roll damage, unless
   the attack has special rules that say otherwise. Some attacks might cause
   special effects in addition to, or instead of, damage.

### Attack Rolls
Your attack roll determines whether or not an attack you make hits or misses its
target. To make an attack roll, roll 3D and add the appropriate modifiers
including any dice pool modifiers such as advantage, disadvantage, etc. If the
total of the roll plus modifiers is equal to or greater than the target's armor
rating, the attack hits. The armor rating of a character is dependent on their
equipment and features, while the armor rating of a creature is listed in its
stat block.

### Melee and Ranged Attacks
Attacks fall into one of two categories: melee attacks and ranged attacks.

#### Melee Attacks
A melee attack occurs when you are making a close-quarters attack on another
creature. There are three common types of melee attacks that you can make in the
game:

___Melee weapon attack.___ A melee weapon attack is made with weapons that are
  used to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Axes, swords, polearms, and whips are
  all examples of weapons that are used to make melee weapon attacks.

___Unarmed strikes.___ Instead of using a weapon, you can use unarmed strikes:
  punches, kicks, etc. Unless otherwise noted, an unarmed strike does
  bludgeoning damage equal to your 1 + your Strength modifier (minimum 1).

___Melee spell attack.___ Some spells also allow you to make melee attacks,
  usually specified as a melee spell attack.

Most creatures have a 5-foot reach, allowing them to attack targets within 5
feet of them. Some creatures (typically larger creatures) have greater reach,
noted in descriptions of their actions, including attacks.

#### Ranged Attacks
Ranged attacks are made with projectile weapons that can target creatures
further away and within a certain range. When a ranged attack has a single range
increment, as with most spells, you can't target a creature beyond the indicated
range. If the ranged attack has two ranges, as with bows, thrown weapons, and
firearms, the smaller of the two numbers is the weapon's normal range and the
larger number is the weapon's long range. Attacks made against targets beyond
the normal range of a weapon have disadvantage. You can't attack a target beyond
the long range of a weapon.

Your ranged attacks are made with disadvantage if they are made while you are
within 5 feet of a creature that is hostile toward you and that creature can see
you and isn't incapacitated. This applies to both ranged weapon attacks and
ranged spell attacks.

### Opportunity Attacks
When a creature exposes itself, it opens itself up to an attack called an
opportunity attack. If the creature is within your reach, you can use your
reaction to make an opportunity attack.

You provoke an opportunity attack if you move away from a hostile creature
without taking the Disengage action.

If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction
to make a single attack against the creature. You can only make one attack when
you make an opportunity attack even if you have a feature that gives you
additional attacks.

### Rally
You can use your action to rally yourself, drawing on an inner reserve of
strength and vigor. By doing so you gain all of the benefits of a short rest.
After you've rallied yourself, you must complete a long rest before you can use
this action again.

### Hidden Attackers and Obscured Targets
If a combatant is hidden, because they have concealed themselves or because they
are invisible, attack rolls made against it have disadvantage. If you make an
attack against a location where you suspect the hidden creature to be, and it is
not there, the attack automatically misses.

When you are hidden, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that
cannot see you. If you make an attack while hidden, you give away your location
regardless of whether you hit or miss with the attack.

## Movement and Positioning
During combat your movement and position can be tracked using either a battle
map or something more abstract. This section presents two options for handling
movement and position in combat.

### Breaking up your Movement
On your turn you can break up your movement. You can use some of your speed
before and after you take an action or bonus action.

When you take an action that allows you to make more than one attack, you can
also break up your movement between each attack.

### Different Movement Speeds
If you have more than one movement speed, such as your normal speed and a
fly speed, your effective speed is equal to the greater of the two speeds. On
your turn, when you move, you may describe your movement as switching between
the two modes of movement.

For example, if you have a fly speed of 60 feet in addition your standard
ambulatory speed of 30 feet, your effective speed is 60 feet on your turn. When
you move you can describe yourself as running before leaping into the air and
continuing your movement in flight.

### Moving Around Other Creatures
In combat you sometimes need to move through another creatures space. Moving
through another creatures space is considered hindered movement for you. The
rules for moving through the area that another creature is in or that it
controls is as follows:

- You can move through the space occupied by nonhostile creatures.
- You can move through the space occupied by a hostile creature only if it is at
  least two size categories larger or smaller than you.
- You can't willingly end your move in the space occupied by another creature.
- If you leave a creature's reach at any point during your move, you immediately
  provoke an opportunity attack from the creature.

### Tight Spaces
You can squeeze into a space that is large enough for a creature one size
smaller than you, for example a large creature can, with some effort, fit
through a door designed for a medium creature and a medium creature can squeeze
itself through a hole that a small creature would have no trouble with. When you
move into and through a tight space you are hindered and you have disadvantage
on attack rolls as well as Agility saving throws. Attack rolls against you are
made with advantage until you clear the smaller space.

### Knocked Down
If you are knocked down or you have intentionally dropped to the ground you are
considered prone, as described in [Appendix A: Conditions](./appendices/A-Conditions.md).

If you are prone it costs half of your speed in movement to stand up. For
example if your speed is 30 you must spend at least 15 feet of movement to stand
up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough speed left or your speed is 0.
While prone you can only move by crawling or use magic such as teleport.
Crawling hinders your movement, as per the hindered condition.

On your turn you can drop prone without using any of your speed.

### Using Battle Zones
For a more abstract representation of the field of battle, you can use battle
zones. Each zone represents an area that actors can move within and between. For
tight-quarters combat there may only be one zone, for combat in an open field
where adversaries start far away from each other it may be typical to have 3 or
4 zones. Despite being more of an abstract representation of the battle, it can
be useful to have a visual aid representing the zones of combat. You can use
pieces of paper, index cards, whatever to represent the zones. If you have a
miniature or a token you can place it on or adjacent to the zone you begin your
turn in.

As a general rule, the area of each zone is considered to be about 30 feet. The
size of a zone is meant to be abstract, but thinking about it in this way makes
it easier to work with character speeds.

If you have a speed of 25 or more, you can move anywhere within the zone you
begin your turn in, this allows you to close the distance with another creature
in the same zone and make a melee attack against it ot to withdraw and make a
ranged attack against any target in range. If your speed is 50 or more, you can
move within the zone you begin your turn in as well as move into one adjacent
zone. Using battle zones encourages characters to take the Dash action to change
zone.

- If you are currently fighting one creature and change targets to a creature
  that is not described as being adjacent to you, this requires that you move
  and you provoke an opportunity attack from any creature you were fighting.
- If you use your movement to withdraw and make a ranged attack you provide an
  opportunity attack from any creature that is still near enough to make melee
  attacks on you.
- For ranged attacks, the storyteller has final say on whether or not a ranged
  attack can be made against targets in any zone. If the battle zones are
  adjacent to one another however, most ranged attacks should be possible
  against any participant in the battle.

#### Detached Zones
In large battlefields, one or more zones may be detached from the rest of the
zones. In this scenario the distance between two detached zones is determined by
the storyteller and if you are attempting to move from one zone to the other it
may require several turns to do so. Detached zones may also have an impact on
ranged attacks.

In some rare cases, the detached zone may not be accessible. The storyteller
should tell you and the other players when a zone becomes inaccessible and the
reason why, if the reason is evident. For example if two ships are fighting a
pitched battle on the open seas, the zones representing each ship are
inaccessible to participants in either zone so they resort to firing ranged
weapons and using spells. You may be able to take actions that make an
inaccessible zone accessible once again, such as steering the ship into the
other ship effectively linking the two previously detached zones.

### Using a Battle Grid
For groups that prefer a more tactical approach to combat, including using
miniatures, you can use battelmaps. A battle map is usually divided into a grid
with each square reepresenting 5 feet of distance. The players and storyteller
place the tokens representing the combat participants on the battle map and on
their turn they move in 5-foot increments across the grid and perform their
actions.

Using a battle grid gives you a very accurate visual for where creatures are and
allows you to think more tactically about the actions you take.

## Cover
Cover provides bonuses to your Defense. You can only benefit from cover if an
attack or effect originates on the opposite side of the object providing you
cover. There are three levels of cover, if multiple sources provide cover only
the source which provides the most protection applies.

- If an obstacle blocks at least half of a target's body, it has half cover.
  When behind half cover, a target has a +2 bonus to their Defense rating and to
  Agility saving throws.
- Obstacles that obscure more than half of a creature but not all of it, provide
  three-quarters cover. A target has a +5 bonus to their Defense rating if it is
  behind three-quarters cover.
- If a creature has total cover, it can't be targeted directly by attacks or
  spells.
