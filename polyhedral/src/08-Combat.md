# Chapter 8. Combat and Conflict
The ring of steel-on-steel, the concussive blast from a cannon sounding above
the din of battle, the clash of magical energies exploding. Combat can be brutal
and bloody.

In the previous chapter, the structure of a {{book.product}} game is discussed,
combat almost always takes place in the context of an action scene. As with all
actions, combat is resolved through a series of dice rolls, namely ability
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.

This chapter details the rules for combat in the {{book.product}} game system, including:

- The **sequence of combat**, following the defined initiative order.
- More detailed explanation of **making attacks**, and **using special actions**
- Character **injury, death, and dying** as well as **healing**.
