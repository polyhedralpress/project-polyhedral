# Chapter 8. Combat and Conflict
The ring of steel-on-steel, the concussive blast from a cannon sounding above
the din of battle, the clash of magical energies exploding. Combat can be brutal
and bloody.

In the previous chapter, the structure of a {{book.product}} game is discussed,
combat almost always takes place in the context of an action scene. As with all
actions, combat is resolved through a series of dice rolls, namely ability
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.

This chapter details the rules for combat in the {{book.product}} game system, including:

- The **sequence of combat**, following the defined initiative order.
- More detailed explanation of **making attacks**, and **using special actions**
- Character **injury, death, and dying** as well as **healing**.

## The Order of Combat
Combat encounters are chaotic melees between two or more groups. The clash of
steel and the dance of adversaries as they feint, parry, and dodge fatal blows
amid a rain of arrows and magic. The {{book.product}} game organizes combat with
an action scene into a cycle of rounds and turns.

Every round represents one-tenth of a minute, or 6 seconds in the course of the
action scene.

A combat encounter follows these steps:

1. **Determine surprise.** The storyteller determines whether any combatants are
   surprised, if they are the combat begins with a surprise round.
2. **Starting positions.** The storyteller sets the stage of the battle and
   works with the players to detemine their characters' positions. In addition,
   the storyteller figures out where the adversaries are in relation to the
   characters.
3. **Roll initiative.** Every actor involved in the combat rolls initiative to
   determine when they act in the combat.
4. **Take turns.** On each participant's turn during the battle, they move and
   take actions including making attacks, defending, etc.
5. **Begin the next round.** After all participants have taken their turns, the
   current round ends and a new round begins. Repeat step 4 and 5 until the
   combat ends.

### Surpise!
Bandits lying in wait on the side of a wooded highway to ambush merchants, and
adventurers descending quietly behind enemy lines to spring an attack. These are
just two examples of situations where one group might take another by surprise.

At the start of combat, the storyteller determines whether any combatants are
surprised. If neither side is attempting to hide or be stealthy, both sides are
aware of each other and there is no surprise round. Otherwise, the Agility
(Stealth) check of the actors or the group that is hiding compared to the
passive Mind (Awareness) score of other creatures. If a creature doesn't notice
the threat it is surprised. A member of a group can be surprised, even if its
allies are not.

If you are surprised, you can't move or take any action (including bonus actions
and reactions) on or before your first turn in the combat.

### Initiative
As discussed in the section on [Game
Structure](./07-PlayingTheGame.html#initiative-order), initiative is what
determines the order of action in the scene, and that includes combat.

Every participant makes an Agility check to determine where in the order of
initiative their turn will fall. The players roll for each of their characters
and any creature they control while the storyteller makes the Agility check for
the non-player characters and creatures. Usually the storyteller will roll for
groups of identical creatures, such that each member of the group acts at the
same time, but it is up to the storyteller to decide how they will roll
initiative.

In the event that two or more creatures are tied for the same initiative, you
can choose how to resolve it, here are a few approaches you might take, you can
also mix approaches:

- Creatures with the highest Agility act first.
- Participants that are tied each roll another Agility check, with the highest
  roll going first among the tied creatures.
- Player-controlled characters have priority over storyteller-controlled
  creatures
- Players decide the order among one another if multiple player-controlled
  characters have same initiatives. Similarly, if multiple
  storyteller-controlled creatures have the same initiative, the storyteller
  decides the order for those creatures.

### Taking Your Turn
On your turn you can do the following: **move** a distance up to your speed,
**take one action** such as making an attack, defending, casting a spell, etc.,
and use one of your **bonus actions**.

#### Movement
On your turn you are able to move a distance equal to your speed.

You decide whether to move before, during, or after your action. Your movement
and the position of enemies might obstruct your ability to take certain actions.
See the section on Movement and Positioning below for more details.

#### Actions
You can take any action presented under [Actions](./07-PlayingTheGame.html#actions)
in Chapter 7, in addition to any actions you have available due to your features
and talents.

The most common action that characters take in combat, however, is the attack
action.

#### Bonus Actions
You may have an ability, from a job, spell, or another source that allows you to
take a special action on your turn called a bonus action. You can take only one
bonus action on your turn, in the event that you have access to more than one
bonus action you must choose which you will use.

Unless a bonus action has specific requirements indicating when it can be taken,
you choose when to take the bonus action. Anything that prevents you from taking
actions also prevents you from using your bonus action.

#### Reactions
Under certain circumstances, or because of an ability that you have, you might
have the opportunity to take a special action called a reaction. Unlike actions
and bonus actions, reactions do not necessarily take place on your turn. A
reaction is a response to a triggering event of some kind. The trigger might
happen on your turn or on another actor's turn.

Opportunity attacks, described later in this chapter, are a common reaction that
all creatures can take.

When you use your reaction, you can't take another reaction until the start of
your next turn. If a reaction triggers on another creature's turn, you can take
your reaction and the creature who triggered the reaction continues their turn
after the reaction is resolved.

#### Other Activities in Combat
In addition to the above, you can do the following on your turn:

- If you are capable of communicating, you are able to do so. You do this
  alongside the actions you are taking. Examples of this are speaking in short
  phrases, issuing single-word commands, and making gestures to your allies (or
  enemies!) alike.
- You can provide more detail to the actions that you are taking, embellishing
  them in such a way that effects neither the action you are taking or your
  movement.
- You can interact freely with one objetc or feature of the environment, as per
  the rules on [Free Interactions](./07-PlayingTheGame.html#free-interactions)
  in Chapter 7.

The storyteller may allow you to perform other activities as part of your turn,
those along with the above may or may not require an action depending on the
complexity or level of focus required for the action you are attempting.

## Making an Attack
Attacking is one of the most common actions in combat. You can make attacks with
melee weapons, ranged weapons, and spells. If you are ever unsure whether an
action you are taking is considered an attack, the rules are simple: if the
action calls for an attack roll the action is an attack.

When you attack another creature, whether it is with a weapon or some spells,
you make an attack roll. All attacks follow the same structure:

1. **Decide on the attack and choose a target.** Choose what attack you are
   going to make and select a target within range. The target could be a
   creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine situational modifiers.** The storyteller will inform you whether
   or not you have an situational modifiers to your dice pool or your roll,
   including whether or not the target has cover, if you have advantage or
   disadvantage, etc.
3. **Resolve the attack.** When you hit with an attack you roll damage, unless
   the attack has special rules that say otherwise. Some attacks might cause
   special effects in addition to, or instead of, damage.

### Attack Rolls
Your attack roll determines whether or not an attack you make hits or misses its
target. To make an attack roll, roll 3D and add the appropriate modifiers
including any dice pool modifiers such as advantage, disadvantage, etc. If the
total of the roll plus modifiers is equal to or greater than the target's armor
rating, the attack hits. The armor rating of a character is dependent on their
equipment and features, while the armor rating of a creature is listed in its
stat block.

### Melee and Ranged Attacks
Attacks fall into one of two categories: melee attacks and ranged attacks.

#### Melee Attacks
A melee attack occurs when you are making a close-quarters attack on another
creature. There are three common types of melee attacks that you can make in the
game:

___Melee weapon attack.___ A melee weapon attack is made with weapons that are
  used to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Axes, swords, polearms, and whips are
  all examples of weapons that are used to make melee weapon attacks.

___Unarmed strikes.___ Instead of using a weapon, you can use unarmed strikes:
  punches, kicks, etc. Unless otherwise noted, an unarmed strike does
  bludgeoning damage equal to your 1 + your Strength modifier (minimum 1).

___Melee spell attack.___ Some spells also allow you to make melee attacks,
  usually specified as a melee spell attack.

Most creatures have a 5-foot reach, allowing them to attack targets within 5
feet of them. Some creatures (typically larger creatures) have greater reach,
noted in descriptions of their actions, including attacks.

#### Ranged Attacks
Ranged attacks are made with projectile weapons that can target creatures
further away and within a certain range. When a ranged attack has a single range
increment, as with most spells, you can't target a creature beyond the indicated
range. If the ranged attack has two ranges, as with bows, thrown weapons, and
firearms, the smaller of the two numbers is the weapon's normal range and the
larger number is the weapon's long range. Attacks made against targets beyond
the normal range of a weapon have disadvantage. You can't attack a target beyond
the long range of a weapon.

Your ranged attacks are made with disadvantage if they are made while you are
within 5 feet of a creature that is hostile toward you and that creature can see
you and isn't incapacitated. This applies to both ranged weapon attacks and
ranged spell attacks.

### Opportunity Attacks
When a creature exposes itself, it opens itself up to an attack called an
opportunity attack. If the creature is within your reach, you can use your
reaction to make an opportunity attack.

You provoke an opportunity attack if you move away from a hostile creature
without taking the Disengage action.

If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction
to make a single attack against the creature. You can only make one attack when
you make an opportunity attack even if you have a feature that gives you
additional attacks.

### Hidden Attackers and Obscured Targets
If a combatant is hidden, because they have concealed themselves or because they
are invisible, attack rolls made against it have disadvantage. If you make an
attack against a location where you suspect the hidden creature to be, and it is
not there, the attack automatically misses.

When you are hidden, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that
cannot see you. If you make an attack while hidden, you give away your location
regardless of whether you hit or miss with the attack.
