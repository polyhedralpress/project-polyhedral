|  1 | I became an ambassador to serve my country.                                                            |
|  2 | The people need a voice in international conversations.                                                |
|  3 | I serve as an ambassador at the behest of my liege.                                                    |
|  4 | Forging treaties and brokering agreements is the highest calling.                                      |
|  5 | I would do anything for the community that supported me, and helped me get where I am today.           |
|  6 | I was inspired by another ambassador who, with only ink and a quill, ended wars and conquered tyrants. |
