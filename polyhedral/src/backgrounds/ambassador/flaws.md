|  1 | The ends justify the means; I will do whatever I need to, in order to survive.                              |
|  2 | I would sooner start a war, than be forced to swallow my pride.                                             |
|  3 | I am known to hold a grudge, if you cross me you will pay dearly for it.                                    |
|  4 | I am a coward and, if it comes down to it, I am willing to risk the lives of others if it will save my own. |
|  5 | I routinely abuse my powers for personal gain.                                                              |
|  6 | I have told so many lies, it is hard for me to recognize the truth.                                         |
