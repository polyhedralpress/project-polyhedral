|  1 | **Peace.** War is a tragedy; it is the job of an ambassador to find ways to end it. (Good)                                  |
|  2 | **Power.** My words and actions have the power to start a war. (Evil)                                                       |
|  3 | **Kingmaker.** Statecraft is a delicate business, and as an ambassador I have the power to topple empires and raise kings without every drawing a blade. (Any) |
|  4 | **Competence.** As an ambassador it is my duty to ensure the goals of the state are realized, regardless of whether I agree with them or not. (Neutral) |
|  5 | **A Voice.** I speak for those who cannot. (Lawful)                                                                         |
|  6 | **Transparency.** Secrets only serve corrupt governments, I will see them dragged into the light. (Chaotic)                 |
