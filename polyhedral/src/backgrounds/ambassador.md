## Ambassador

You are, or possibly once were, a diplomatic emissary to a foreign land;
appointed by a nation or a governing body to oversee negotiations and
practice statecraft. You may have advocated for the protection or interests
of the people you represent, or used your status as a cover for clandestine
operations. Some ambassadors are responsible for brokering agreements,
treaties, and other covenants.

### Feature: Request Audience

While in a peaceful nation where your role as a diplomatic emissary is
recognized, you may use your status as an ambassador to request an audience
with powerful and influential figures. Your request for an audience is
guaranteed to be considered, but there are no assurances that the meeting will
occur or that you will meet with the official you requested an audience with.

### Suggested Aspects
Ambassadors serve a foreign government, either because they feel that it is a
noble calling or because it is a position of power. Many ambassadors are members
of the upperclass, owing their position to their natural born privilege. For
others though, like those in more egalitarian societies, the opportunity to
become a foreign dignitary is open to all, regardless of who their parents were.
Ambassadors might find themselves party to many secrets before they become
public knowledge, as such it is not uncommon for spies and other intelligence
agents to front as aides to an ambassador to as ambassadors themselves.
