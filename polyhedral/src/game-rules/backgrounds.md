## Backgrounds
Your character's background sheds light on who you were before the game begins.
It provides context on where you came from and in some cases who you came to be
who you are today. How were you educated? Did you grow up privileged? Were you a
trouble maker? Your background might answer questions like this and others. Even
if it doesn't, asking similar questions can provide insight into not only your
background, but also your personality, what you value, and even your flaws.

### Aspects
Every background presented here provides suggestions for aspects, e.g.
personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. These aspects of your character
build on and support your concept. The aspects presented are only suggestions
however. You can pick the aspects that suit your character, randomly choose them
by rolling dice, or work with your storyteller and the other players to write
your own.

___Personality traits.___ A personality trait might be something you like, a
particular attitude you have towards something, a previous accomplishment,
mannerisms, upbringing. From your story think about your defining event or how
your character acted when having to make an important decision.

___Ideals.___ Your ideals are your beliefs. These are the fundamental moral and
ethical principles that guide you. Consider why your character acts a certain
way. What are your character's goals and ambitions? What causes them to stand up
after having been knocked down?

___Bonds.___ Look at your relationships with other characters in your story. What
connects you to a person or a place? A bond might tell you who is important to
you, or identify something that you cherish deeply.

___Flaws.___ Your flaws are your vices, or some aspect of your character that
complicates matters. It might be a compulsion to act in a certain way, a fear,
or a weakness. Look to the rising conflict in your character's backstory, how
did that influence you? What makes your character mad? What terrifies your
character more than anything in the world?

> ### Optional Rule: Creating Relationships
> After you have decided on your background, work with the storyteller and other
> players in the game to create relationships between the characters. The
> relationships that are created are a result of collaboration between two
> players. Using this optional rule, each character will have a relationship with
> two different characters at the start of the game.
> 
> Characters can be randomly shuffled and distributed among players, if sitting at
> a table they can be passed to the left and right, or players can decide who they
> want to make their relationships with. Regardless of how you decide on who the
> relationships are with, the process for creating a relationship remains the
> same:
> 
> 1. Decide on a characteristic as the **basis of the relationship**. Whether it
>    is the character's personality trait, ideal, bond, or flaw choose one of
>    these to build the relationship on top of. For example, the player of the
>    warrior-mage Tellus may decide to create a relationship between their
>    character and the thief Garret who has the flaw "I am slow to trust others."
> 2. Write **one or two sentences describing the relationship**. When you write
>    the relationship, think about in the context of a supporting role in someone
>    else's story. Your relationship might be based on helping the other character
>    or your presence might have been a complication. Do not be concerned with
>    being too detailed. Continuing with the example above, Tellus' player may
>    write the following relationship "After saving Garret's life Garret and
>    Tellus became close friends." 
> 3. **Discuss the relationship with the other player** and make adjustments. A
>    relationship is not one-sided, afterall. For instance, Garret's player may
>    suggest a modification to the proposed relationship: "After saving Garret's
>    life, at risk of his own, Garret and Tellus became close friends." This
>    acknowledges that it took an extraordinary event&mdash;Tellus risking his
>    life to save Garret's&mdash;for them to become friends.
