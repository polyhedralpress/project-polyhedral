## Explation

### Vision and Light
In exploration and when characters find themselves in precarious situations,
like combat, it becomes important to notice signs of danger. Many actions rely
on your ability to see and darkness or other effects that obscure your vision
can be a hinderance.

Most creatures can see normally in areas of bright light, such as outside during
the daylight. Illumination from torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources cast
bright light within a defined radius.

Shadows and other areas of dim light, create a lightly obscured area. The
boundary between bright light and darkness is usually an area of dim light. The
threshold of light at the dawn and twilight of the day also counts as dim light.
A brightly lit night sky might also provide enough light to be considered dim
light.

Darkness is the absence of any significant light sources. An area covered in
darkness is heavily obscured. The dark of night typically casts an area in
darkness, as do the corridors of an unlit dungeon or an underground cave.
Magical and non-natural sources can also cover an area in darkness.

#### Visibility
A given area might be either lightly obscured or heavily obscured.

___Lightly Obscured.___ In areas that are lightly obscured, creatures have
disadvantage on Mind (Awareness) checks that involve sight. Examples of lightly
obscured areas are: dimly light rooms, a light fog, or light-to-moderate
foliage.

___Heavily Obscured.___ In an area that is heavily obscured, creatures are
considered blinded (see appendix A). Darkness, a thick fog, or dense foliage are
examples of environments that block vision completely.
