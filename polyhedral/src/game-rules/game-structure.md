## Game Structure
A scene is the basic unit of {{book.product}}'s game structure. Scenes in
{{book.product}} are classified as either **narrative scenes** or **action
scenes**. The way time and movement is handled for each scene is different.

Narrative scenes typically advance the story, while action scenes are commonly
used to handle combat. However, any scenario that would benefit from tracking
the actions of actors in a more granular way can be handled as an action scene,
for example a chase through a city's back alleyways or the elaborately planned
heist that requires precision and coordination between all members of the team.

During the course of a game you will switch between narrative and action scenes
as the story progresses and the adventure unfolds.

### Initiative Order
In an action scene it is important to understand the order in which characters
and creatures will act. When the characters enter into an action scene, the
storyteller will ask them to roll their Initiative. The initiative order, or
initiative, is what determines the order of action in the scene. Actors with a
higher initiative go sooner than those with lower initiatives.

Every participant in an action scene rolls 3D + their Agility modifier. The
result of this roll determines when an actor will take their turn during the
action scene. If two or more actors have the same initiative roll, the one with
the higher Agility rank goes first. If there is still a tie, the tied actors can
roll their Initiative again to determine who goes first among them.

### Time
A large part of the game is spent in narrative scenes. In a narrative scene,
time tracking will often be rough. Typically only important or noteworthy events
will be described during narrative time. For example, if a character wants to go
to the market to purchase some tools and equipment for an upcoming adventure the
storyteller may say: "After an hour or two you acquire the equipment you were
looking for without any trouble and return to the group."

During an action scene, time is tracked more carefully. Action scenes are
divided into rounds and turns. Each round is 6 seconds long, or one-tenth of a
minute. During a round every actor gets a turn and acts in the Initiative order
determined at the start of the action scene. Once everyone has acted the round
ends and a new one begins.

### Movement
Like time, movement is tracked differently in the context of a narrative scene
as compared to an action scene.

Narrative movement can be summarized by the storyteller without necessarily
providing precise distances or calculating the amount of time that has passed
while traveling. Sometimes it is important to know how long it will take to get
from one location to another or how far the characters have travelled. In these
cases, the storyteller considers the speed of the creatures traveling and the
terrain that they are traversing.

In action scenes movement is often more precise, sometimes measuring the
distance a character can travel in 5 feet increments.

#### Speed
Every creature, including characters, has a speed in {{book.product}}. A
creature's speed is measured in feet and represents the number of feet that the
creature can walk in 1 round.

#### Travel Speed
Used in narrative scenes, a creature's travel speed is a rough calculation of
how much distance it can travel in 10 minutes, an hour, or over the course of a
normal day. The pace at which characters move has an impact on how aware they
are of their surroundings as well as what they can do while traveling.

The approximate distances that a character can travel overland on foot, based on
their pace, is shown in the table below:

| Pace   | Hour       | Day      | Effect                                             |
|--------|------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Normal | 3.5 miles  | 28 miles | &mdash;                                            |
| Slow   | 1.75 miles | 14 miles | Advantage on Awareness checks, and can use Stealth |
| Fast   | 5 miles    | 40 miles | Disadvantage on Awareness checks                   |

Riding mounts, driving vehicles, or other special modes of transportation allow
characters to travel more quickly. The rules for these alternative methods of
travel contain more information on the distance that they can cover in a given
period of time.

#### Difficult Terrain
The distance an actor can travel in both narrative and action scenes assumes
that the terrain is easily navigable: flatlands, roads, open plains,
unobstructed passages, etc. Unfortunately not every landscape is so friendly.
Thick forests, obstacle-ridden paths, steep-and-difficult to navigate mountains,
and similar environments often impede a creature's movement. Features like these
are considered **difficult terrain**.

When traversing difficult terrain you move at half your speed. In an action
scene, 1 foot of distance over difficult terrain costs 2 feet of your speed. For
narrative scenes where travel is involved, you are only able to cover half the
normal distance in a given period of time.
