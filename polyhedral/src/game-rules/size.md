## Size and Space
Every creature has a size category. Your size also indicates how much space you
control in an action scene, such as combat. The amount of space you control is
not a representation of your physical dimensions, but rather your reach. A
creature's space also reflects the area that it needs in order to maneuver and
move comfortably. In combat this is especially important. Sometimes objects also
use the same size categories as creatures.

The Size Categories table below indicates the size of a creature and the space
it controls.

| Size       | Space                   |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ feet           |
| Small      | 5 by 5 feet             |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 feet             |
| Large      | 10 by 10 feet           |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 feet           |
