## Saving Throws
When your character is the target of an effect that would impede them or injure
them, sometimes they are given the opportunity to resist against it. The act of
resisting might be involuntary&mdash;as with the body's ability to withstand
poison or disease&mdash;or active&mdash;such as evading an explosion. When a
character resists something they make a special check called a saving throw.

When you choose your character's starting job you gain proficiency in two saving
throws. Making a saving throw is the same as making any ability check, if you
are skilled in a saving throw you add your skill bonus to the roll. If you are
unskilled your dice pool is modified by &minus;1D.
