## Actions
Whether they are in or out of combat characters and other creatures can take
actions to interact with the world. In a narrative scene, these actions usually
take the form of ability checks using skills, in combat the most common action
is the attack action. This section presents the most common actions that are
taken by characters and creatures.

You can always use your turn to perform an action that uses an ability such as
using one of your skills, tools, or applying your knowledge. In addition as you
advance in a job, gain talents, or acquire special items you will gain
additional actions that can be taken.

> #### Free Interactions
> As part of your movement or any action you take, you can freely interact with
> your equipment and the environment around you. For example, at the start of
> combat when a character moves and makes an attack with their sword they draw
> it from its sheath first before swinging it. The act of drawing the sword
> happens as part of the character's movemnet or the Attack action they take,
> they do not need to declare a separate action to draw the weapon.
> 
> Generally speaking, characters can interact freely with their surroundings
> once each turn assuming the interaction does not require concerted effort.
> Opening an unlocked door as you move, severing a rope securing a chandalier,
> and knocking over random objects as you run through a crowded bazaar are all
> examples of free interactions. If you wish to interact with more than one
> object or the object in the environment requires more effort, you must take
> the Use an Object action. The storyteller has final say on whether or not you
> can freely interact with an object.

### Attack
In combat, the most common action taken is the Attack action. When you take the
Attack action you make one melee or ranged attack. See "Making an Attack" in
[Chapter: Combat](../08-Combat.md) for the rules around making an attack.

Some features allow you to make more than one attack when you take the Attack
action, such as the Extra Attack feature.

### Cast a Spell
You use your action to cast a spell. Every spell has a casting time associated
with it, you can use your action to cast any spell with a casting time of 1
action. If a spell has a casting time of 1 bonus action you must use your bonus
action to cast the spell.

On your turn you can cast two spells if one of those spells has a casting time
of 1 action and the other has a casting time of 1 bonus action, if and only if,
one of the spells being cast is a cantrip; these spells can be cast in any
order.

For more details on using magic and casting spells, see [Chapter: Magic](../09-Magic.md).

### Dash
When you take the Dash action you use your action to double your movement speed
for the turn.

### Defend
When you take the Defend action, you spend your turn focusing on blocking and
evading attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against
you has disadvantage provided that you can see the attacker. In addition, you
make Agility saving throws with advantage. If you are slowed, incapacitated, or
your speed is reduced to 0, you lose this benefit.

### Disengage
By taking the Disengage action, until the end of your turn, your movement no
longer provokes attacks of opportunity from other creatures.

### Grapple
You can use your action to attempt to grapple, pin, or hold another creature
preventing them from moving on their turn. When you attempt to grapple a target,
make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by a target's Agility (Acrobatics) or
Strength (Athletics) check. If you succeed, the target is grappled (see:
[Appendix A: Conditions](./appendices/A-Conditions.md)).

### Help
When you use your action to aid another creature, you can do one of the
following:

___Assist on an ability check.___ Choose a skill that you are proficient in and
a creature who can see or hear you. That creature has advantage on the next
ability check it makes with the chosen skill. To give this assistance, you must
be near enough to the creature to provide verbal or physical aid when the
creature makes the check. The storyteller decides whether or not it is possible
for you to assist another creature.

___Assist on an attack roll.___ By momentarily distracting a target within 5
feet of you, you grant advantage to the next creature that attacks the target
before the start of your next turn.

### Hide
When you take the hide action you conceal yourself from other creatures. While
you are in a lightly or heavily obscured environment, behind three-quarters
cover, or behind total cover you can use your action to hide. You cannot hide
from a creature if you are visible to it, or its allies; if the creature you are
trying to hide from is in your line of sight, then you are visible to it. To
hide, make a difficulty 15 Agility (Stealth) check. On a success, you are hidden
and the result of your check becomes the difficulty for a creature to find you
with a Mind (Awareness) check.

You give away your position and cease being hidden if you make a sound louder
than a whisper, you are discovered, you use your action to make an attack or
cast a spell, when you are no longer heavily obscured, or when you are no longer
behind cover.

### Push, Pull, or Shove
When you take the push, pull, or shove action you are attempting to move another
creature or object that is resisting that movement. The resistance may be
intentional, as with an adversary trying to keep his or her balance or it may be
involuntary, such as when an ally is stuck and you are attempting to pull them
through a space that is too small for them. In some cases, the resistance is
simply the weight of the object, as with a large statue or wagon which you are
trying to use as a barricade.

___Pushing, Pulling, or Shoving a Creature.___ If you attempt to push, pull, or
shove a creature you must make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by the
creature's Strength (Athletics) or Agility (Acrobatics). If you win the opposed
check, you are successful at moving the other creature. You are able to push or
pull a creature up to 10 feet when you take this action. If you used the shove
action the creature falls prone (see [Appendix A:
Conditions](../appendices/A-Conditions.md)).

___Pushing, Pulling, or Shoving Objects.___ If you attempt to push, pull, or
shove a particularly large or heavy object the storyteller determines the
difficulty of the task and you make a Strength (Athletics) check against that
difficulty. If you succeed you are able to push, pull or knock over the object
with a shove. Pushing or pulling an object in this manner allows you to move it
as part of your move, however when doing so your movement speed is halved just
as it would be if you were navigating difficult terrain. If you took the shove
action the object falls over, possibly breaking as a result.

### Ready
By taking the ready action you choose not to act on your turn and instead
declare what action you will take when a triggering event occurs. If the
triggering event occurs, you use your reaction to respond to it.

As part of readying an action, you can also reserve any speed you have not
already used to move as part of executing your readied action.

### Search
If you cannot see a creature because it is hidden, invisible, or for any other
reason you can spend your action attempting to search for it. When you search
for a creature make a Mind (Awareness) check by against the creature's Stealth.
If you equal or exceed the creature's Stealth you find it and it is no longer
hidden.

### Use an Object
When an object requires more effort to use and you can't use your free
interaction to perform the task, such as winding a heavy rope around a
counterweight, you can take the Use and Object action. You can also use this
action when you want to interact with more than one object in an environment on
your turn.
