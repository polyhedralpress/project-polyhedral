## Skills, Tools, and Knowledges
Every skill in the game is associated with a primary ability, e.g. athletics and
Strength ability, deception with Presence ability, etc. The association between
a skill and ability reflect the most common uses of the skill.

When you want to use a skill, the storyteller will call for an ability check and
tell you what ability to use with your skill, e.g. Strength (Athletics) for
leaping from the roof of one building to the next. In some cases, a storyteller
might also ask for an ability that isn't typically used with the skill, e.g.
Vitality (Athletics) to hold your breath for a long period of time.

In addition to skills, characters may also have knowledge about certain topics
or proficiency with tools.

### Skills
Skills are areas of training that apply to more specific tasks and are
associated with a primary ability. The following list presents the skills and
the abilities that they are primarily related to.

An ability check with a skill can use an ability other than its primary ability,
for example if a character wishes to intimidate another creature in a show of
strength the storyteller might ask for a Strength (Intimidate) check instead of
the standard Presence (Intimidate) check.

- **Strength:** _Athletics_
- **Agility:** _Acrobatics_, _Sleight of Hand_, _Stealth_
- **Vitality:** _Endurance_
- **Mind:** _Awareness_, _Investigation_, _Insight_, _Survival_
- **Spirit:** _Resonance_
- **Presence:** _Deception_, _Intimidation_, _Performance_, _Persuasion_

#### Acrobatics
Your Agility (Acrobatics) check is a measure of your coordination and balance,
such as when you are attempting to keep your footing on unsteady ground. In

  climbing equipment.

  rooftop to another.
