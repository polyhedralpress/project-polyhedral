## Character Origins
The first step in creating your character for {{book.product}} is to come up
with a concept, and that concept starts with your identity. Familiarize yourself
with the setting of your game and look at the options for your character's
origins. A character's origin is defined as the intersection between their
lineage, their cultural heritage, and their background.

Your character receives certain traits and features from their choices of
lineage, culture, and background. These traits may be physical characteristics:
lifespan, size, the ability to see more clearly in low-light, etc. or they may
be features of your upbringing or experience such as having certain knowledges,
skills, or tools.

In some rare cases, a character might not get to choose their cultural heritage
or the cultural heritage will look slightly different.

> #### Mixing Lineage and Culture
> While most origins present a lineage and one or more related cultures, you
> typically have the option to mix those lineages and cultures. Before choosing a
> culture from a different lineage, speak with your storyteller first to
> understand if there are any restrictions.
