## Resources
To simplify accounting in {{book.product}}, character wealth is tracked as
**resources**. Resources are an abstraction over how much money a character has,
no matter whether the currency is in dollars, credits, gold, platinum, gems, or
something else. {{book.product}} instead focuses on a character's resources and
the relative cost of goods to a character's buying power.

Every character has a Resources rank, which indicates the class of goods that a
character can buy without endangering their lifestyle.

| Lifestyle   | Resource Rank | Cost of Good Classification |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Poor        | 1-2           | Common                      |
| Modest      | 3-4           | Uncommon                    |
| Comfortable | 5-6           | Rare                        |
| Affluent    | 7-8           | Very Rare                   |
| Wealthy     | 9-10          | Legendary                   |

### Pooling Resources
Characters can pool their resources to purchase more expensive goods. If two or
more characters in the same lifestyle class (e.g. modest or comfortable) pool
their resources their pooled Resource rank is considered to be equal to the
highest rank in the pool +1 for every other character contributing to the pool.

For example if three characters with Resource ranks Modest (3), Modest (3) and
Modest (4) pool their resources: their pooled rank is Comfortable (6). Starting
from the character with Modest (4) and increasing by +2 ranks from the two
Modest (3) characters.

The storyteller has final decision on how many expensive items you may purchase
with your pooled resources.

### Spending Beyond Your Means
Sometimes you don't have the luxury of pooling your resources, but you still
need to make a purchase that is beyond your normal spending power. You can spend
resources beyond your normal means, when you do this you gain access to goods
one lifestyle level higher than your current level. After making your purchase,
your Resources rank is temporarily reduced by 1 (minimum of 0). Your resources
remain reduced until you complete an adventure or you take downtime activity to
restore your reduced resources.

For example, a character with a Modest (3) resources wants to buy an item that
is available to characters living a Comfortable-or-better lifestyle. The
character overextends themselves to gain access to the item in this class of
goods, after the purchase is made their Resources rank is temporarily reduced by
1 to Poor (2).

### Changes to your Resources Rank
Between adventures, during downtime, you can spend time trying to improve your
lifestyle. You can do this by practicing a profession or by taking risks, like
gambling. Not all activities result in an increase to your Resources rank. In
addition, the results of your adventures may also impact your Resources rank.
The storyteller has final say on how your efforts, both during and between
adventures, might change your Resources rank.

### Optional Rule: Using Currencies
If you really want to use currency in your game, go for it! We anticipate that
some players like amassing wealth and keeping track of a ledger for their
character. To this extent, there is an appendix for the equipment listed in this
chapter that supplies suggested costs by genre.
