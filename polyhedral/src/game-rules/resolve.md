## Resolve
Resolve is your character's mastery over themselves, their environment, and
their own destiny. It is the manifestation of a character's force of will,
either through effort or sheer luck. Your character begins play at 1st level
with a Resolve equal to your Spirit modifier (minimum of 1).

You gain an additional point of Resolve every 10 levels, e.g. at 10th level,
20th level, 30th level, etc.

You can use your character's resolve to modify ability checks, attack rolls,
saving throws, and any other roll of the dice. You can also use your resolve to
gain an extra turn during combat or to influence the events of the story by
invoking one of your character's aspects.

#### Spending Resolve
You can spend resolve to affect any check you make or to use it to assert a
modicum of control over the story. When you spend a resolve, you can do one of
the following:

- You gain +1D an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you make. You can
  roll this additional die even after you've made the roll and know the result.
- You can nudge the result of any check, including those made by others, by
  +/&minus;2
- At any point during combat you can immediately take an extra turn.
- When you fail a death saving throw you can spend a resolve to instead turn the
  failure into two successes.
- Whenever you're in a situation where one of your character's aspects or
  relationships might be applicable, you can influence the story in some way by
  declaring a story element, such as: introducing an NPC, acquiring a clue, or
  defining a relationship between your character and an NPC. There are a number
  of ways to invoke your character's aspects, described in more detail below
  (see: **Declaring a Story Detail**).

Whenever you choose to invoke one of your aspects you should explain or justify
how it is helpful in the situation in order to get the benefit of invoking it.
Usually this is self-evident, sometimes it might require creativity on your
part.

You cannot invoke an aspect more than once on a single roll.

The storyteller might apply additional restrictions or allow for other creative
ways of spending resolve during a scene. Sometimes it may be necessary to spend
2 or more points of resolve to achieve a desired outcome. For example a
storyteller might allow you to spend two resolve to turn a normal hit into a
critical hit, or to turn an enemy's critical hit into a normal one.

#### Declaring a Story Detail
A character's defined aspects can be used to add a detail to the story that
works in their character's favor. By spending resolve and selecting one of your
aspects, you can alter the story by introducing an element to it. For example,
you might use an aspect to declare that you previously met the tomboy princess
in a crowded market while she was disguised as a commoner and that before you
and your companions are sentenced to imprisonment after being falsely accused
she recognizes you and intervenes on your behalf.

To do this, you inform the storyteller that you would like to invoke one of your
aspects by spending your resolve. You should justify your story details with the
storyteller. A storyteller can decline the proposed invocation of your aspect if
it doesn't seem to fit with your character or fit with the current circumstance
in the scene. Sometimes, the storyteller might ask you to revise the story
detail before accepting it. A resolve is only spent if the storyteller accepts
your proposed story detail.

#### Regaining Resolve
Between adventures, you can regain any previously spent spent resolve. A
storyteller can also choose to restore your resolve depending on your actions
during a session or at the end of a chapter in a story.

In addition to the above, the storyteller can compel your character to act
according to their personality trait, bond, flaw, ideal, disposition or other
aspects. A storyteller might do this to make the world respond to your
character, complicate a situation for them, or create unexpected drama.

When one of your aspects is compelled, you must either agree to accept the
compulsion, regaining a resolve for your trouble, or to spend a resolve to
ignore the compulsion. If you have all of your resolve, you may prevent a
compulsion from happening without spending and losing any resolve. If you have
no resolve remaining, you must agree to the compulsion.

A compulsion might result in:

- An automatic failure.
- Your choices in how to respond to a situation becoming restricted.
- Unintended consequences result from whatever your character does.

You may negotiate with your storyteller about the details and result of
accepting the compel, to arrive at an appropriate and dramatic moment.
Ultimately, the storyteller has final say on whether or not to compel a
character and how the compulsion manifests.

> ##### Players and Compelling Aspects
>
> Normally, storytellers decide when to call for compulsions. Players might
> suggest a character, either theirs or another, be compelled but the decision
> lies with the storyteller.
>
> As a storyteller however, you can decide to give your players slightly more
> influence in the game by allowing them to compel each other's characters. This
> can create a fun dynamic in some groups, but it is not for everyone. Before
> giving this power to your players, it is recommended that you discuss it with
> the group first.
