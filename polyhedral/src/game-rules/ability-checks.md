## Making Ability Checks
{{book.product}} is built around the idea that characters interact with the
world around them as a direct result of the actions that they perform. The
outcomes of those actions are resolved, primarily, through three types of rolls:
**ability checks**, **attack rolls**, and **saving throws**.

Ability checks are made when a character or creature takes an action and there
is a possibility of failure. If there is no possibility of failure, a
storyteller does not (and should not) call for an ability check. Attacks, while
they use your abilities, are resolved using different rules. All checks are made
against a target number, the check's **difficulty**. Making a check is easy:

1. **Roll your dice pool and add modifiers.** When you make a check roll your
   dice pool (typically 3D) for the check and add ability and skill modifiers to
   the roll.
2. **Apply bonuses and penalties.** Circumstantial bonuses and penalties from
   conditions, features, spells, equipment, and other effects are either added
   or subtracted from the check.
3. **Compare the result with a target difficulty.** Compare the total result of
   the check, after all modifiers, bonuses, and penalties are applied to a
   target difficulty. If the result equals or exceeds the target number the
   check is a success, otherwise it fails. The storyteller usually decides how
   difficult an action is, sometimes the players know the difficulty in advance
   other times it is unknown.

### Ability Check Difficulties
When calling for an ability check, the storyteller decides which ability is
relevant and the difficulty of an action being performed.

| Difficulty        | Target     |
|-------------------|------------|
| Very easy         | 6 or less  |
| Easy              | 9          |
| Average           | 12         |
| Moderate          | 15         |
| Hard              | 18         |
| Very hard         | 21         |
| Heroic            | 24         |
| Nearly impossible | 27+        |

___Very Easy.___ Tasks of this difficulty are ones that just about anyone can
do. These checks should be rare and only if a failure has significant
consequences to the scenario in play.

___Easy.___ Most characters will have little trouble with these tasks, but an
unskilled character may find a modicum of challenge in performing them.

___Average.___ Even skilled characters may fail at an average difficulty task.
Consistent success requires experience and training, or a character needs to be
naturally talented.

___Moderate.___ Tasks of this difficulty require higher levels of skill to be
successful at. Unskilled characters may still succeed at moderate difficulty
tasks but this often requires luck and advantageous circumstances.

___Hard.___ These tasks are truly challenging, even to skilled characters. A
character must either be very skilled or very lucky.

___Very Hard.___ Tasks of this level of difficulty are those that masters of a
skill or craft are capable of performing; few others will be successful.

___Heroic and Nearly Impossible.___ Tasks of heroic and nearly impossible
difficulties test even the most proficient, experienced, and skilled characters.
Success often requires more than a modicum of luck or ideal circumstances.

### Skilled vs. Unskilled Checks
If you are skilled in a check, also sometimes referred to as being proficient,
your base dice pool for an action is 3D. When you make the check you can add
your skill bonus to the roll modifiers. If you are unskilled, or not proficient,
in a check your dice pool is reduced by &minus;1D and you do not add your skill
bonus when determining the result of the roll.

### Passive Checks
Passive checks are special ability checks that resolve without rolling any dice.
This type of check is usually used by a storyteller to determine the results of
frequent or trivial tasks, especially where failure does not have a significant
consquence to the current scene. For example, a storyteller may use a creature's
passive Mind (Awareness) check to determine if that creature notices something
in a forest when it is otherwise not expecting any danger.

You determine the total for a passive check by:

<p style="text-align: center;">
10 + all modifiers that apply to the check
</p>

When a check would normally have a dice pool modifier, e.g. advantage or
disadvantage, additional modifiers are applied to the passive check's total:

- For every +1D that would be applied to a check's dice pool, the passive check
  total has a +5 bonus.
- For every &minus;1D that would be applied to a check's dice pool, the passive
  check total has a -5 penalty.

For example, a character with a Mind of 14, is skilled in Awareness, and has a
skilled modifier of +2 has a passive Mind (Awareness) of 14.

### Providing Assistance
An actor can provide assistance to another creature by taking the Help action
(see: [Actions](#actions) below). In order to assist another creature on an
ability check, that actor must be proficient in the skill that you are trying to
help with. By assisting another creature, that creature gains advantage on the
skill check.

### Group Checks
When three or more actors work together to accomplish the same action, they do
so by making a group ability check. When a group ability check is made, each
participant makes the check. If at least half of the group succeeds, then the
group check is a success, otherwise it fails. A storyteller might ask for a
group check if all of the characters are searching an environment for clues, or
when a group is attempting to pass themselves off as an official delegation in
order to gain access to a secure area.

### Opposed Checks
When a character's or creature's action is directly opposed by another actor,
the storyteller might call for an opposed check. This might happen when the two
actors are attempting same action, or attempting to counter the effort of one
another, for instance both are pulling on a rope in opposite directions.

When making an opposed check, both participants make an ability check. Instead
of comparing the result of these checks to a difficulty, however, they are
compared to one another. The actor with the highest check total wins the
contest. In the event of a tie neither participant makes progress and the
situation remains as it was before the opposed check was made.
