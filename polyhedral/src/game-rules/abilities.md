## Abilities
Every creature, including characters and non-player characters, has six
abilities that are used to describe its general aptitude, those abilities are:
**Strength**, **Agility**, **Vitality**, **Mind**, **Spirit**, and **Presence**.
These abilities govern the physical, mental, and spiritual or magical aspects of
a creature. The ranks of these abilities typically range in value from 3 to 20,
though some creatures may have ability ranks as low as a 1 or well-above 20. The
modifiers associated with these ability ranks are applied to almost every action
in the game.

- **Strength**, a measure of raw physical prowess and power.
- **Agility**, a measure of speed and manual dexterity.
- **Vitality**, a measure of stamina.
- **Mind**, a measure of mental faculties including wit, reasoning, memory, and
  observation.
- **Spirit**, a measure of spiritual or magical attunement.
- **Presence**, a measure of social skills and personality.

A character interacts with the world by performing actions. These actions may be
scaling a wall, searching for clues, or even making an attack. When you take an
action, if there is a chance of failure or the outcome is uncertain you allow a
roll of the dice to determine the result.
