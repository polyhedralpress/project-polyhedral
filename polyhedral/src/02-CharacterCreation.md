# Chapter 2. Character Creation

Before you begin playing {{book.product}}, you will first need to create a
character. This chapter outlines the steps necessary for creating your
character. Your character is your avatar; it is how you will interact with and
experience the worlds of play in {{book.product}}. A character is born from your
imagination and is represented by a collection of features and qualities that,
through in-game mechanics, enable fair arbitration of the actions you perform
during the course of the story.

Creating a character straight forward:

1. Choose your character's origin (lineage, cultural heritage, and background)
2. Decide on your character's disposition
3. Assign ranks to your abilities and distribute ability rank bonuses
4. Select a starting job
5. Record starting items and equipment

### 1. Choosing a Character's Origin
Every character has an origin, this origin includes their biological lineage
(i.e. human, elf, dwarf, etc.), the culture that they were raised in, as well as
their background. Your lineage, cultural heritage, and background define the
traits that your character begins the game with.

Your character's cultural heritage does not need to be the same as your lineage,
for instance a human may be raised in a dwarven city and therefore begin play
with one of the dwarven cultural heritages selected.

### 2. Decide on your Character's Disposition
In addition to the aspects from your background, your character has a
disposition. Your disposition reflects how your character perceives the world
and carries themself. You can read up more on dispositions in
[Chapter: Character Options](./05-CharacterOptions.md) and see a list common
dispositions.

### 3. Assign Ranks to your Abilities
Your ability ranks influence your actions in the world. When you create your
character you assign starting ranks to each of your abilities.

There are three common methods for assigning ranks to your abilities: you can
generate them by rolling dice, you can use a point-buy method, or you can use a
predefined array of ranks.

#### Randomly Generating Ability Ranks
To generate the six ability ranks randomly, roll four six-sided dice (4d6) and
discard the lowest die result. Add the three remaining values together and
record their sum, e.g. if you rolled a 1, 3, 5, and 6, you would discard the 1
and add the 3, 5, and 6 together for a total of 14. Repeat this process seven
times: once for each of the six abilities and one extra time. From the seven
results, choose six of them and assign them to your abilities however you would
like.

Players may roll their ability ranks individually, or the ability ranks can be
rolled as a group. When generating ranks as a group, the seven ability ranks
are rolled and the results are shared by all players; each player chooses and
assigns their ranks as if they had rolled the results individually.

#### Point Buy
Instead of rolling your ability ranks, players are given a certain number of
points to invest (or "buy") into their character's abilities at the start
of the game. As an ability score increases in value and rank, it becomes more
costly to increase it further. Depending on the theme of the game, a storyteller
may choose to give players more or fewer points to use when creating their
characters.

Using the point buy method, every character begins with a starting score of 10
in each ability and 15 points to spend on increasing their ability ranks. The
storyteller can opt to give characters additional points to spend during this
process if they so choose. Increasing an ability score costs 1 or more points.
You can reduce an ability's starting rank below 10 to a minimum of 8, by doing
so you gain +1 point which can be used to purchase ranks.

The table below shows the total cost to purchase an ability score of a
particular value. In the table below, advancing an ability score to 16 or 17
through point assignment is only possible if the storyteller allows it or the
characters have been issued more points to spend.

| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| 10    | 0    | 14    | 5    |
| 11    | 1    | 15    | 7    |
| 12    | 2    | 16    | 10   |
| 13    | 3    | 17    | 13   |

#### Predefined Ability Ranks
Instead of rolling or buying into your ability ranks, all characters
begin with the same array of six numbers to distribute into their character's
abilities. These ability ranks are in alignment with the point costs defined
above.

The standard ability ranks array is: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8

#### Ability Rank Bonuses
Ability rank bonuses are applied after you've assigned ranks to your character's
abilities. Choose one of the two following options:

- Increase one ability of your choice by 2 and a different ability of your
  choice increases by 1.
- Three abilities of your choice each increase by 1.

### 4. Selecting a Starting Job
Once you have made decisions about your character's origin, disposition, and you
have assigned ability ranks to the character, choose a starting job for you
character. Your job identifies the training that your character has undergone up
until the point that they enter the story and helps you to understand part of
the role they will play in the group and in the game.

### 5. Items and Equipment
As part of the process up until now, you were given choices for starting
equipment. In addition you have a starting level of resources. You can use your
resources to purchase additional gear, goods, and equipment.
