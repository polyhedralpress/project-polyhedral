# Chapter 1: Introduction

{{book.product}} is a role-playing game system with collaborative storytelling
at its core, and it and shares similarities with other narrative forms including
childhood games of make-believe, writing, and acting.

{{book.product}} is fueled by its players' imaginations. The scenarios that are
described by storytellers to the players are backed by the structure of rules
and mechanics that allow for fair arbtration of rules. To play {{book.product}},
players create characters—some times these characters are heroes, some times
they are villains. {{book.product}} is best played in a group of four-to-five
players, each playing their own characters. Together, the group might explore
ancient ruins, a vampire's castle, the outer reaches of the galaxy, and other
places that are limited only by the group's imagination. At these locations the
group may talk with other characters that are part of the story's tapestry,
compete against adversaries, solve puzzles, and discover secrets long since
buried.

{{book.product}} presents the rules you need to run a game, and nothing you
don't. It is a system that is designed to be extended and modified to fit the
needs of the game and the story being told.

## Why {{book.product}}?
There are innumerable games and game systems out there, so why choose
{{book.product}}? {{book.product}} has been built to be compatible with popular
games, as well as with a preference toward being an open system with no
licensing. In addition, it embraces modularity.

___True, open gaming.___ {{book.product}} is free. It is open source. It has a
permissive, industry-standard, license—the Creative Commons CC BY license. We
want everyone to use {{book.product}}, to remix it, build on top of, and to
redistribute it without any barriers.

___Modular by design.___ The core of {{book.product}} is rules-light. It aims to
include the absolute minimum set of game rules and details necessary to run a
game of {{book.product}}. Since all rules interact with the core mechanics, it
is possible to add and remove systems mostly independently without impacting the
other parts of the game.

___Highly compatible.___ {{book.product}} can be easily adapted for other gaming
content, rules and guides for conversion can be found alongside this and other
resources for {{book.product}}.

## Using this Book
The {{book.product}} is divided into a few parts:

- **Part 1** deals with character creation and character details, as well as a
  primer on important aspects of the game (how to make ability checks, etc.)
- **Part 2** covers rules related to playing the game, combat, and magic.

Throughout this book the rules address you, the player or the storyteller. The
book will occassionally refer to any character or creature taking an action with
the more generic "actor". As a player, "you" can mean either your character or a
creature that you control.

## Players
Everyone at the table who is playing {{book.product}} is a player. One of
the players takes on a special role of the storyteller.

Players take on the role of characters in the story, these characters can also
be referred to as player characters (or PCs), differentiating them from
non-player characters (NPCs, the characters that a storyteller controls).
Sometimes a player also controls creatures or other characters.

### What does the storyteller do?
The role of the storyteller is important to most games in {{book.product}}
because not only are they responsible for framing the world and the story that
the other players are engaging with, but it is also their responsibility to act
as a fair arbiter of the rules of the game.

Does every game of {{book.product}} need a storyteller? More often than not, the
answer is yes. There may be certain situations where a storyteller is not
strictly necessary, though you may have a better experience with someone taking
the role of the storyteller.

The storyteller does not need to be the same individual every time, in fact
every player is encouraged to take on the role of storyteller as they gain
confidence. This gives everyone a chance to play in, as well as run, games in
{{book.product}} and helps everyone enjoy the game equally.

Some of the things a storyteller does are:

___Act as the story's narrator.___ The storyteller is responsible for narrating
the events of a story to the players, describing them in as best detail as he or
she can so that the players can picture what their characters are seeing. As a
narrator the storyteller aims to pace the story such that scenes flow seamlessly
and give the players a chance to experience the world as if they were
experiencing it first hand. In addition to providing descriptions, the
storyteller is also in control of the individuals—both good and bad—that the
characters encounter along their journey. The storyteller gives voice to the
characters' allies and their enemies alike. As the storyteller, your duty as
narrator is the most important part you will play in a game.

___As the story's author.___ Many times a storyteller is not just the narrator,
but they are the author of the story. They are responsible for the ideas and
themes, along with the creation of the people and places that the characters
will interact with on their journey.

___Rules arbiter.___ During the game you will almost certainly need to resolve
rules disputes. This will be easier the more familiar you are with the rules of
the game and any modular content that is being used. As the storyteller it falls
on you to decide how a given rule will be applied.

### What the storyteller is not
The storyteller's role often puts them in what is seemingly an adversarial
position to the other players, after all they are the person who is presenting
challenges and deterrents to the characters. However, the players are not trying
to win against the storyteller and neither is the storyteller trying to win
against the players.

## How to Play
The following section is a quick overview of the elements of game play in
{{book.product}}. Some of this is discussed in more detail later in the book.

### The D6
At its core, {{book.product}} is designed to be played using only six-sided
dice, also known as d6's. Generally a player will roll three six-sided dice, or
3d6, when their character performs an action. This is sometimes referred to as
the character's **dice pool**. The result of this roll, along with any modifiers
applied, determines outcome of the action. In order to simplify the presentation
of game mechanics, the number of six-sided dice that a player should roll is
denoted with the number of dice, followed by a 'D', e.g. 3D. The number of sides
of the dice (6) is left off because all dice in {{book.product}} use a six-sided
die.

If a dice roll has a modifier applied to it, that will be denoted with either an
addition or subtraction of the modifier after the dice representation, e.g. 3D+5
or 3D–1.

### Dice Pool Modifiers
Sometimes your character might have a modifier to their dice pool. Most commonly
this is when your character has advantage, disadvantage, or is unskilled. A
modification to your dice pool is presented as either a &minus;1D or +1D to the
roll. Some circumstances may modify your dice pool by two or more dice, but
these are less common.

___Advantage.___ With advantage on a check, you have a +1D to that check's dice
  pool. You either have advantage or you don't. If multiple situations grant
  advantage, you only gain the +1D dice pool bonus from one of those situations.

___Disadvantage.___ With disadvantage on a check, you have a &minus;1D to that
  check's dice pool. You either have disadvantage or you don't. If multiple
  situations impose disadvantage, you only suffer the &minus;1D to your dice
  pool from one of those situations.

___Unskilled.___ If you are unskilled with or in a particular skill, tool,
  weapon, knowledge, saving throw or check that you are making you have a
  &minus;1D to the check's dice pool.

When you have both advantage and disadvantage, no matter how many circumstances
grant or impose the benefit or penalty, the situations cancel each other out and
you are considered to have neither advantage or disadvantage. For example, if
you have advantage from two sources and disadvantage from a third, you do not
have either advantage or disadvantage on the roll and there is not change due to
these circumstances to your dice pool.

The above are only a few examples of common dice pool modifiers. There may be
other circumstances that grant bonuses or impose reductions to your dice pool.
Your dice pool for any check can not be reduced to less than 1D.

### Critical Successes
A critical success occurs on any check you are performing where you roll two
or more 6's on the dice. You can only score a critical success when your dice
pool is at least 3D, if your dice pool is greater than 3D (because of advantage
or some other reason), you have a greater chance of scoring a critical success.

### Applying Rules
If two rules seemingly contradict one another, the more specific of the two
rules is applied. If it isn't clear which rule should be applied or there are no
rules for a given situation, the storyteller is responsible for adjudicating and
resolving the situation. The storyteller may also decide that they are not using
certain rules.

### Always Round Down
Whenever a number is divided in the game, always round down if you end up with a
fractional number, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. This greatly
simplifies the math in the game.

## Character Advancement
Your character's growth is tracked in levels. For every 1,000 experience points
(typically abbreviated as XP), you gain a level.

Everytime you gain a level, you can do one of the following:

- Increase one ability rank by +2, or two ability ranks by +1.
- Gain a rank in a job, provided you meet any necessary requirements.
- Gain a talent, provided you meet any necessary requirements.

While most play occurs in your character's first 25-30 levels, there is no limit
to the number of levels a character can gain.
